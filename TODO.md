# Persistence

* Look into lazily fetching on demand via Lazy<T> with a GraphRepository reference

# Testing

* See if agent warnings can be eliminated (different mocking tool?)
* Refactor test classes for code duplication

# Next Steps

* Break out persistence into multiple strategies (separate for current vs history)
* Add strategy and graph walker for higher-order use cases
